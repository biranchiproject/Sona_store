Create a professional Play Store–like web platform named "Sona’s Store".

Core Concept:
- This is an App Store for installable web apps (PWAs) only.
- No APK, no ZIP, no native downloads.
- Apps are installed using the browser’s native "Install / Add to Home Screen" feature.
- User experience should feel like Play Store’s “GET APP” flow.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication
  - Google (Gmail) login
  - GitHub login
  - Email + Password signup/login
  - Forgot password via email reset / OTP link
- Database: Dummy JSON / mock data (replaceable later with Firebase Firestore)
- PWA Support: Full (manifest.json + service worker)
- Hosting-ready (HTTPS assumed)

Design & Theme:
- Black background (dark mode default)
- Neon accent colors (blue / purple / green glow, your choice)
- Modern, minimal, premium UI
- Play Store–inspired layout (not a clone)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth hover + glow animations

Platform Architecture:
- ONE WEBSITE with role-based access control (no separate admin site)

User Side Features:
1. Homepage
   - App grid with cards
   - Each card shows app icon, name, short description
   - "GET APP" button

2. App Details Page
   - Screenshots
   - Full description
   - Category
   - Developer name
   - "GET APP" button
   - Trigger browser install prompt if PWA installable
   - Otherwise open app URL in Chrome

3. Authentication
   - Login / Signup page
   - Options:
     - Continue with Google
     - Continue with GitHub
     - Email + Password
   - Forgot password:
     - Send secure email reset link / OTP via Gmail
   - Logout
   - User profile page

4. User App Submission (optional but included)
   - Submit PWA app URL
   - Upload icon
   - Status: Pending / Approved / Rejected
   - Users can see their submission status

Admin Side Features:
1. Admin Route: /admin
2. Access only if user.role === "admin"
3. Admin Dashboard
   - Total apps
   - Pending submissions
4. App Management
   - Add new PWA apps
   - Edit app details
   - Approve / Reject user submissions
   - Remove apps
5. Normal users must be blocked from admin routes

Database Models (Mock Data):
apps:
- id
- name
- description
- iconUrl
- pwaUrl
- category
- status (approved / pending / rejected)
- createdAt

users:
- uid
- name
- email
- role (admin / user)

PWA Requirements:
- manifest.json with:
  - name: "Sona’s Store"
  - icons
  - theme_color
  - background_color
  - start_url
  - display: standalone
- Service worker for installability and basic offline support
- App opens fullscreen after install (no browser UI)

Security & Rules:
- Only HTTPS app links (no localhost)
- No APK or ZIP handling
- No phone permissions
- No WebView-based fake apps
- Use Firebase Auth best practices
- Add clear comments where Firebase config and Firestore will be connected later

Project Structure:

  components/
  pages/
  hooks/

  routes/
  controllers/
  data/
  middleware/

Goal:
Generate a fully working base project for "Sona’s Store" that:
- Looks and feels like a real app store
- Uses PWA install behavior ("GET APP")
- Has professional authentication (Google, GitHub, Email/Password)
- Includes admin approval workflow
- Is clean, secure, beginner-friendly, and easy to extend later

Add clear comments in the code explaining:
- Where to paste Firebase keys
- Where to replace mock data with Firestore
- Where to add deployment config later
